## Upstreet DAO Charter

v0.1 (Draft)

### Preamble

In recognition of the transformative potential and boundless opportunities presented by an expansive metaverse, we the members of Upstreet DAO unite behind a shared commitment to foster an open, inclusive, and decentralized digital realm aligned with principles of freedom and user control.

### Article 1: Vision and Mission

#### 1.1 Vision

Our vision is of an open, inclusive and permissionless metaverse where human creativity, collaboration and self-expression can thrive. A metaverse that uplifts human dignity and potential rather than diminishes it. A metaverse that aligns with our deepest values around freedom, privacy, access, and self-determination rather than centralized control and surveillance capitalism.

#### 1.2 Mission  

The Upstreet DAO is an open community of builders, creators and technologists united by a common mission:

To develop the core protocols, standards, tools, applications and decentralized infrastructure necessary for an open and user-controlled metaverse to emerge.

To empower all people to fully own their digital identities, creations, connections and transactions across the open metaverse. 

To enable creators and developers to build interoperable experiences, economies and communities that uphold civil liberties and human rights.

To model open, transparent and decentralized governance that gives the community control over the growth and evolution of the open metaverse.

### Article 2: Guiding Principles

The Upstreet community is guided by the following interrelated principles that shape our work in building the open metaverse:

#### 2.1 User Agency & Control

We build technologies and frameworks that put users in control of their digital lives, enabling true self-sovereignty and agency within the metaverse.

#### 2.2 Open & Neutral Protocols

We develop open protocols and standards that remain neutral and censorship-resistant, upholding the right to free expression and access.

#### 2.3 Permissionless Innovation 

We cultivate an environment of permissionless innovation where anyone can build, create and contribute free of gatekeepers.

#### 2.4 Full Portability & Interoperability

We enable seamless interoperability between metaverse environments and applications, with full portability of digital assets and data.

#### 2.5 Inclusive Participation

We empower broad, global participation in the metaverse by making it inclusive and accessible to all.

#### 2.6 Privacy & Security

We bake in privacy-preserving technologies throughout the stack to protect users' personal data and digital rights.

#### 2.7 Fairness of Exchange

We build technologies and frameworks that implement fair exchange of economic value in metaverse.The creators and developers of virtual items who work with the land, built environment, avatars or other virtual items on Upstreet must be able to trust that the primitives and protocols used for building the Upstreet, implement optimistic fair exchange and guarantee strong fairness of transactions to all correctly behaving parties during the protocol run. For the sake of clarity: both "strong fairness" and "optimistic fair exchange protocol" are established technical concepts used in the context of commercial transactions that are made over open networks.

#### 2.8 Transparency & Accountability

We maintain clear accountability through open and transparent processes, responsible data practices and ethical governance.
